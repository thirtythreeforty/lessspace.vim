*lessspace.txt*           LessSpace: Better whitespace stripping for Vim

                                                       *lessspace-intro*
This simple plugin will strip the trailing whitespace from the file
you are editing.  However, it does this only on the lines you have
visited in Insert mode; it leaves all the others untouched.

USAGE                                                  *lessspace-usage*

    For basic usage, just install it and forget it.  LessSpace works
    automatically.

    LessSpace provides a couple commands that allow you to turn it on
    or off, either globally or per-buffer.  The global commands are:

        - `LessSpace`     Turn on whitespace stripping       *:LessSpace*
        - `LessSpace!`    Turn off whitespace stripping      *:LessSpace!*

    The per-buffer commands are very similar:

        - `LessSpaceBuf`  Turn on whitespace stripping    *:LessSpaceBuf*
        - `LessSpaceBuf!` Turn off whitespace stripping   *:LessSpaceBuf!*


======================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                  *lessspace-configuration*

    LessSpace doesn't offer many configuration options, because
    everything happens automatically when you enter and leave Insert
    mode.

                                                   *g:lessspace_enabled*
    You can disable LessSpace on startup by setting the
    |g:lessspace_enabled| variable:
>
        let g:lessspace_enabled = 0
<
    (The same effect can be achieved after startup by just running
    |:LessSpace!|.)

                                                    *g:lessspace_normal*
    By default, LessSpace strips whitespace after normal mode
    operations (such as when you |put| something from a register).  If
    you don't want this, you can have LessSpace only work in insert
    mode by setting |g:lessspace_normal|:
>
        let g:lessspace_normal = 0
<
                                             *g:lessspace_defer_current*
    If you don't like it when LessSpace strips whitespace out from
    under your cursor (moving it in the process), you can enable
    deferred stripping, which strips the current line's whitespace
    only after you move the cursor away, or save the file:
>
        let g:lessspace_defer_current = 1
<
    By default, this is not enabled, to maintain consistency with the
    behavior of all other lines.

                                                 *g:lessspace_whitelist*
                                                 *g:lessspace_blacklist*
    You can also specify the filetypes that it operates on by
    specifying a filetype whitelist or blacklist.  By default, nothing
    is blacklisted.  You can change this by setting either of the
    `g:lessspace_whitelist` or `g:lessspace_blacklist` variables,
    probably in your |vimrc| file.  These variables should be lists of
    the desired filetypes.  For example, to only operate on Vim and
    Ruby files, you could use:
>
        let g:lessspace_whitelist = ['ruby', 'vim']
<
    And to operate on everything but Python files:
>
        let g:lessspace_blacklist = ['python']
<
    (Previously, the whitelist had to be specified as a regex string.
    If you are using this form, you should update to the list-based
    method, as this will be removed soon.)
